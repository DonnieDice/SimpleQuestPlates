## Version 1.5.2

### ðŸš€ Quest Detection Overhaul

This release introduces a completely new, more reliable quest detection system that properly handles World Quests and improves overall accuracy.

### âœ¨ Fixes & Improvements
- **World Quest Support**: The addon now correctly identifies and displays progress for World Quests.
- **Detection Accuracy**: The quest detection logic was overhauled to directly match monster names against your quest log, rather than relying on less reliable tooltip data. This ensures all quest types are handled correctly and consistently.

### ðŸ“¦ Installation
Copy the SimpleQuestPlates folder to your Interface/AddOns directory for:
- Retail (The War Within)
- Classic Cataclysm
- Classic Era
- MoP Classic
- Wrath of the Lich King Classic
